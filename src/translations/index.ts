    storyTitle: "From Self-Doubt to Permission",
    storyP1: "For years, I waited. For something. For someone, or some kind of sign to tell me I was good enough at what I do—or want to do—and that it's okay to stop striving for perfection, to stop needing to improve, and just begin. AND to earn money for it.",
    storyP2: "A PhD, scholarships, years in academia, countless courses, certifications, all kinds of therapy… all of it was meaningful and helpful. But that spark that says, \"You've arrived. You're enough. You're allowed to take up space and earn money doing what you love\" - that can't come from anyone else. I felt it over the years, but there comes a point (and for me age was helpful), that shrinking myself and playing the old doubts is just too boring and I got the kick in the butt I need.",
    storyP3: "I started letting go of shame, owning my spirituality, trusting my intuition, and daring to say what I really want. Things started to shift much faster, and life became more fun despite all the bad things happening around and I could finally be much more active in doing something about it, in the right way for me.",
    storyP4: "Recently I discovered the Sacred Money Archetypes®, and they gave me validation for something I had always felt: I'm an Alchemist, Connector and Nurturer - idealistic, creative, striving on relationship and deeply caring. And it's absolutely okay to earn money from it. The archetypes also helped me see that this gift needs structure, support, and boundaries to truly thrive (and earn).",
    storyP5: "In everything I've done, I've always helped people around me move from overthinking and struggle to simplicity, creative joy, and fulfillment. And now I'm doing it in the realm of money.",
    storyHighlight: "I'm not a financial advisor, but I am an expert in helping you let go of old stories and transform your entire relationship with yourself, with the world, and with money. I also see deeply into your potential and possibilities and I will kick YOUR butt so that you don't give up on yourself.",
    storyClosing: "If you long for meaningful connection, impact, and the ability to receive money through work that lights you up—I'm right here with you. 💛 The world needs more money in the hands of women who care.",
